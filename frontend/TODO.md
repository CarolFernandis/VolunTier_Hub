# Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create VolunteerDashboard.jsx component with simple features: profile info, applied opportunities list, link to opportunities page.
- [x] Create HostDashboard.jsx component with simple features: profile info, posted opportunities list, button to create new opportunity.
- [x] Update App.jsx to add routes for /dashboard/volunteer and /dashboard/host.
- [x] Test the routing by running the dev server and navigating to the new routes.
- [ ] Optionally, update Login.jsx to redirect to respective dashboard after login (mock for now).
